# ADPT - Adaptive-Development-Programming-Tool
ADPT (Adaptive Development Programming Tool) is a modular, multi-language programming system. It lets developers write frontend, backend, and database code in one file or multiple files, using unique IDs for linking. Language blocks are isolated and can be temporarily disabled for testing using /dis.

This project was more for fun and nothing serious, so I won't be posting it. I enjoyed writing the Syntax and designing the logo!
